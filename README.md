🚀 Today’s SQL + Excel Learning Adventure
🔍 SQL Deep Dive
✅ Mastered New SQL Operators:

IN → A cleaner alternative to multiple OR conditions. (e.g., WHERE country IN ('USA', 'UK'))

BETWEEN → Perfect for filtering ranges (dates, numbers, etc.). (e.g., WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000)

LIKE → Powerful pattern matching with wildcards:

% = any sequence of characters (e.g., WHERE name LIKE 'A%' → names starting with "A")

_ = single character placeholder (e.g., WHERE code LIKE 'AB_1' → matches "ABC1", "ABD1", etc.)

💡 Key Insight: These operators supercharge the WHERE clause, making queries more efficient and readable!
